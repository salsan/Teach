# Teach
Teach is a basic scenes theme for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)  for teach Chess online with [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/)

# About
My brother [Alessandro](https://lichess.org/coach/newbie87), responsible for the project ["Sicilia Scacchi Online"](http://www.siciliascacchi.it/site/presidenza/__trashed-3), asked me how to stream with the same graphics and in a "simple" way for different teacher with different hardware on twitch.
Just for fun, I developed this project, and I choice Lichess for Chessboard for easy method to share it ( [Lichess Study](https://lichess.org/study) ),I was looking for a software that would allow to export full scenes theme, I have not found anything , the finally choice point to OBS Studio, for resolve this issue, I wrote a Nodejs script for export/import/extract/add scene with relative files  this program is ["OBS Themes Utility"](https://github.com/salsan/otu).
